Throughlines provide markers as we move forward through our work at CEISL and its related project, the Digital Education Hub.

Each throughline is supported by a definition and a series of commitments. The definition provides a working understanding of what the intentions of the throughline is. The commitments outline a series of ideas and actions that provide a view of what the throughine-in-action looks like.

This repository contains the JSON file for the Throughlines.
